# The entries below are test/example JWTs that were temporarily hardcoded during
# development for testing the OpenID4VCI credential issuance flow. These JWTs:
# - Were used only for local development and testing
# - Have since been removed from the codebase
# - Were never valid credentials for any production system
# - Only exist in historical commits, not in the current code
